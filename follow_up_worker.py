followup_worker.py — standalone background process. Polls Supabase every
30 seconds for customers who haven't replied within their follow-up window,
sends a reminder (or escalates on the second miss), fully independent of
the main webhook/queue pipeline since nothing "arrives" to trigger this.

Deploy as its own Render Background Worker (separate from the message
queue worker) with: python followup_worker.py
